Volunteer service, donations, and more are very important in keeping our community united. We, as part of a new organization called Iowa City Community Involvement, are trying to build links between youths and the community by setting up times to volunteer as a group, putting up information about different Iowa City area services and events on our website, providing a website where people can easily find out how to volunteer in various locations throughout the community, and more.
<br><br>
To help us out on our endeavor, any information about upcoming events, how to volunteer at your location (and any orientation classes necessary to partake in volunteering if applicable), any services or goods you might need, or anything else you would like to get out into the community would be great. We would also like permission to use any information found on your website to promote your cause.
<br><br>
Thank you,<br>
Iowa City Community Involvement</span></p>
